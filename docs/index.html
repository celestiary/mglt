    <h2>SGLT</h2>
    <p>The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03005">A mission
    architecture to reach and operate at the focal region of the solar
    gravitational lens</a> proposes a Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL)
    Telescope at ~500 AU that would use the gravitational lens created
    by the Sun.

    <p>Einstein in 1915 predicted that the Sun's gravitational field
    would deflect light by Î˜=1.75, which confirmed by
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_experiment">Eddington
    experiment</a> in 1919.

    <p>In 1936 Einstein
    <a href="http://personalpages.to.infn.it/~zaninett/projects/storia/einstein1936.pdf">discussed
    the possiblity of a ring lens</a> being observable from a suitable
    location, though he considered it practically impossible that we
    would find any.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens">Actual
    gravitational lenses</a> have since been observed.

    <p>The SGLT would be positioned to take advantage of the Sun's
    gravitational ring lens.  This calculation checks that tangent of
    the Sun's deflection is nearly equal to the expected solarRadius /
    500 AU for the SGLT.

    <p>This graphic is a helpful visulation for the geometry for a complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring">Einstein Ring system</a> as observed from Earth.  The SGLT geometry would be similar, but with a much longer D<sub>L</sub>.
